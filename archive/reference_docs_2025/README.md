# Archived Reference Documentation

**Archived**: December 26, 2025

## Purpose

These reference files were consolidated into a single comprehensive document:
`BIRAVA2025/reference_systemDocumentation.md`

## What Was Preserved

The consolidated document captures:
- Design principles and development methodology
- System architecture and class hierarchies
- Constructor signatures and call patterns
- Core algorithms (6-phase construction, 9-step matching)
- Data specifications (key formats, CSV export, Google Drive IDs)
- Production operations workflow
- Match override system specification
- Critical files reference with tier rankings

## What Was Filtered Out

The following types of content were intentionally not preserved:
- Step-by-step session logs and debugging histories
- Obsolete implementation plans for completed work
- Redundant descriptions of the same concepts
- Temporary analysis documents

## File List

50 reference files archived from the BIRAVA2025 root directory.

## Retrieval

If specific historical detail is needed, these files remain available in this archive folder.
